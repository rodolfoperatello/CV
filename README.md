Rain is a financial wellness benefit that possibility employees withdraw (at a small fee) up to half of their
earned-wage-on-demand anytime. As a Backend Software Engineer, I was designing and creating
solutions based on microservices architecture following hexagonal architecture pattern and agility methods
Scrum and Kanban.
The applications were responsible to generate automatic invoices and its email notification for each
employee’s pay cycle.
File-based Integration with several employers. The deduction file consists of a detailed description of the
sum of all withdrawal requests made by employees of a given employer. To ensure security and reliability
in confidential information the files are encrypted with a PGP key.
Provide APIs to a tooling portal so the invoices and the deduction file can be managed internally and
externally by employers and operation teams.
